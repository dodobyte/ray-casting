Ray casting code is only ~50 lines of code. Rest of the code is for loading map, initializing SDL etc.

There is basic input handling and no collision detection. Map is a simple text file.

You can create a Wolfenstein 3D like game with ray casting. You should add features like simple texture mapping, a pair of hands holding gun, some enemy sprites and so on.
